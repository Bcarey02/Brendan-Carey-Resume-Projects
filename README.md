Hello! Welcome to my GitHub repository for potential employers.
I've posted some of my projects/work here for you to get a sense of my progeamming skills. 

I'd first like to explain Amazon Adventure.
It's a text-based adventure game made using python.
It has three endings and the control scheme can be confusing. 
That's because it's based on an old game called Pyramid 2000 for the TRS-80.
