Hello! Welcome to my GitHub repository for potential employers.
I've posted some of my projects/work here for you to get a sense of my programming skills. 

-Amazon Adventure-
It's a text-based adventure game I made using Python and Spyder IDE.
It has three endings and the control scheme can be a bit confusing. 
That's because it's based on a very old game called Pyramid 2000 for the TRS-80.
Feel free to try your hand at it or just look over the code!
