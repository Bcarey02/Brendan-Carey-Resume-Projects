Hello! Welcome to my GitHub repository for potential employers.
I've posted some of my projects/work here for you to get a sense of my programming skills. 

Python:

-Paragraph Analyzer-
This program takes a paragraph provided by the user and finds its average sentence length, percent hard words,
average number of syllables, and readability using two seperate indices.
The text files in the folder are some example inputs and their respective outputs.

-Amazon Adventure-
It's a text-based adventure game I made using Python and Spyder IDE.
It has three endings and the control scheme can be a bit confusing. 
That's because it's based on a very old game called Pyramid 2000 for the TRS-80.
Feel free to try your hand at it or just look over the code!

-Object Oriented Programming-
This is an assignment that showcases my skills with python classes.

SQL:

-Class System-
This is a database I made in MySQL Workbench.
It consists of three tables: department, course, and course section.
